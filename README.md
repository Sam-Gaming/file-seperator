# file-separator
Separate files



to make it work you need to put your file path in the path variable and if you want the separated files to be in a separate folder not in the folder where the nonseparated files are you have to add the extension path and modify it to where you want the separated files to be
If you do not want the files to be in a different folder you can change/modify the 17th line and change the desired_path to be simply path
